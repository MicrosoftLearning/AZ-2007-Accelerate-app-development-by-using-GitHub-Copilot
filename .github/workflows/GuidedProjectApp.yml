# This workflow is triggered on two events: workflow_dispatch and push.
#
#   - The workflow_dispatch event allows you to manually trigger the workflow from GitHub's UI. 
#   - The push event triggers the workflow whenever there's a push to the master branch, but only 
#     if the changes include files in the LearnModuleExercises/SampleApps/** directory.
#
# The defaults section sets the default shell for all run commands in the workflow to PowerShell (pwsh).
#
# The workflow consists of a single job named CreateGPZip, which runs on the latest version of Ubuntu. 
#
# This job has three steps:
#
# 1. The Checkout step uses the actions/checkout@v4 action to checkout the repository's code onto the 
#   runner. This is a common first step in most workflows as it allows subsequent steps to operate on 
#   the codebase.
# 
# 2. The Create GuidedProjectApp zip step changes the current directory to ./LearnModuleExercises/GuidedProject 
#   and then creates a zip file of all the files in that directory, including those in the .vscode 
#   subdirectory. The -r option is used to zip directories recursively and the -q option is used to run
#   the command quietly without printing a lot of output. The resulting zip file is saved in the 
#   ../Downloads directory with the name GuidedProjectApp.zip.
# 
# 3. The Commit and push step uses the Endbug/add-and-commit@v7 action to add the newly created zip file 
#   to the repository, commit the changes with the message 'Updating Zip for API source files', and then 
#   push the changes back to the repository. The add input is set to the path of the zip file and the push
#   input is set to true to enable pushing.
#
# This workflow is useful for automatically packaging and versioning sample applications whenever changes 
# are made to them.
